        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Jack, I'm currently in the last year of my M.S. in Computer Science at WashU in St. Louis. I've always wanted to be a game developer,
            but since the start of college I've also had a big interest in machine learning as well. I felt like my resume was not quite adequate to truly express myself, so I've made this site as well!
            This site showcases my projects, skills, and game design ideas in a way that is more in depth than my LinkedIn or my resume. You can use the navigation
            Feel free to use the menu above to explore the different sections of my portfolio, or you can use the hyperlinks below. Always feel free to reach out!
