                        <h3>Passive: Hextech Lengthening</h3>
                        <p>Every time Jirran uses an ability, he expends a little bit of hextech from his reserves to extend the length of his sword. After this occurs 4/5/6 times, his sword shrinks down to the length of a dagger while his hextech reserves are recharging.</p>

                        <p>Jirran spins in a circle, holding his sword out and hitting all enemies within range. The radius of the attack increases corresponding to his sword length. If he has reserves when he spins, he expends 1 hextech charge from his reserves to lengthen his sword, which will remain that length until his hextech reserves deplete.</p>

                        <p>Jirran firmly places his sword into the ground and uses it to vault forward. The length and speed of his vault will depend on the length of his sword.</p>

                        <p>Jirran lunges forward with his sword, striking enemies in a straight line directly ahead of him. If he has reserves when he spins, he expends 1 hextech charge from his reserves to lengthen his sword, which will remain that length until his hextech reserves deplete.</p>

                        <h3>R: Hextech Overload</h3>
                        <p>Jirran overloads the battery on his hextech backpack, temporarily granting him infinite hextech charges. This allows him to stack his sword length as many times as he can. This effect lasts for 4/6/8 seconds.</p>

                <h2>Lore</h2>
                <p>Jirran once dreamed of being a gymnast, but his lack of talent prohibited him from success in the field. After studying hextech in school, he went on his own to do more research and eventually created the sword-extending hextech that he uses now. He is envious of those who were naturally successful and takes great offense when people discredit his ability due to his use of hextech.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="champion-playstyle">
                <h2>Playstyle</h2>
                <p>Jirran often uses his sword to tease and taunt his enemies until he can go in for the kill. As the sword gets longer, this becomes easier. He uses the sword to poke his laner down until they are low enough that he can hop in using pole vault and then finish them off.</p>

                        <h3>Passive: Star Infusion</h3>
                        <p>Elara's basic attacks are infused with celestial energy, dealing bonus magic damage periodically. The infusion strengthens under moonlight, increasing the frequency of bonus damage after 3 consecutive attacks.</p>

                        <p>Elara channels her bow, launching a powerful arrow that deals damage to the first enemy hit. The arrow explodes upon hitting an enemy, dealing area damage to nearby enemies within a small radius.</p>

                        <p>Elara calls upon celestial energies to create a protective shield around her, absorbing incoming damage. While the shield is active, her movement speed is slightly increased, allowing her to reposition quickly.</p>

                        <p>Elara fires a concentrated beam of moonlight in a straight line, piercing through all enemies it hits. The beam slows affected enemies, allowing Elara to follow up with additional attacks.</p>

                        <p>Elara summons a shower of shooting stars that bombard an area, dealing continuous damage to all enemies caught within. The barrage lasts for a short duration, heavily damaging anyone who remains in the area.</p>

                <h2>Lore</h2>
                <p>Elara hails from the celestial realm, a guardian tasked with maintaining balance between the stars and the earth. She draws strength from the constellations, channeling their power through her bow to defend the world from dark forces threatening to disrupt the cosmic harmony.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="champion-playstyle">
                <h2>Playstyle</h2>
                <p>Elara excels at long-range engagements, using her radiant arrows to strike from afar while keeping her distance from threats. Mastery of positioning and timing her abilities to maximize damage output is key to dominating in battles. Utilizing her shield and mobility ensures she can maintain a safe distance or quickly reposition for strategic advantages.</p>
