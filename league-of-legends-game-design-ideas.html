                Jirran, The Variable Swordsman

                            <h3>Passive: Hextech Lengthening</h3>
                            <p>Every time Jirran uses an ability, he expends a little bit of hextech from his reserves to extend the length of his sword. After this occurs (4/5/6) times, his sword shrinks down to the length of a dagger while his hextech reserves are recharging.</p>
                            <h3>Passive: Hextech Reserves</h3>
                            <p>Jirran charges hextech reserves via his backpack. At any time, his maximum reserves are (4/5/6) depending on level. When Jirran's reserves run dry, his sword shrinks down to the length of a dagger for X seconds while his reserves are re-charging. During this time, Jirran can still use abilities, but these abilities will not trigger any hextech charges.</p>

                            <h3>Q: Stretching Cyclone</h3>
                            <p>Jirran spins in a circle, holding his sword out and hitting all enemies within range of it. The radius of the attack increases corresponding to his sword length. If he has reserves when he spins, he expends 1 hextech charge from his reserves to lengthen his sword, which will remain that length until his hextech reserves deplete.</p>
                            <p>The spin speed is inversely related to the length of his sword. Jirran will spin the fastest when his sword is short, and he will spin the slowest when his sword is long. He can move while casting this ability, but his movespeed will also change based on the length of his sword. If his sword is small, he will gain a small burst of movespeed in his current direction, if his sword is long, he will lose a small bit of movespeed instead.</p>

                            <h3>W: Pole Vault</h3>
                            <p>Jirran firmly places his sword into the ground and uses it to vault forward. The length and speed of his vault will depend on the length of his sword. If his sword is short, the vault will be short and fast. If his sword is long, his vault will be long but slower. This skill is reset if Jirran has a kill or an assist on an enemy champion that has died within the last 10 seconds.</p>

                            <h3>E: Stab</h3>
                            <p>Jirran lunges forward with his sword, striking enemies in a straight line directly ahead of him. If he has reserves when he spins, he expends 1 hextech charge from his reserves to lengthen his sword, which will remain that length until his hextech reserves deplete. The longer Jirran's sword the more fragile it is, and the less enemies it can damage at once. While his sword is short, this ability will pass through a max of X enemies, but when his sword is at its longest, it will only hit the first target it comes in contact with.</p>

                            <p>Jirran overloads the battery on his hextech backpack, temporarily granting him infinite hextech charges. This allows him to stack his sword length as many times as he can. This effect lasts for (4/6/8) seconds.</p>

                <div class="champion-lore">
                    <h2>Lore</h2>
                    <p>Jirran once dreamed of being a gymnast, but his lack of talent prohibited him from success in the field. After studying hextech in school, he went on his own to do more research and eventually created the sword-extending hextech that he uses now. He is envious of those who were naturally successful and takes great offense when people discredit his ability due to his use of hextech. He has combined his gymnastics knowledge with the combat knowledge from living in the slums of Zaun and transformed into the hextech-sword-wielding gymnast that he is today.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="champion-playstyle">
                    <h2>Playstyle</h2>
                    <p>Jirran often uses his sword to tease and taunt his enemies until he can go in for the kill. As the sword gets longer, this becomes easier. He uses the sword to poke his laner down until they are low enough that he can hop in using pole vault and then finish them off with the quick and deadly dagger-length sword. He enjoys movespeed, and any hindrance to this will slow down his acrobatics as he is performing his abilities. Managing and properly expending his hextech charges in the right scenario is going to be the difference between good and great Jirran players.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="potential-design-pitfalls">
                    <h2>Design Pitfalls</h2>
                    <p>I think that making Jirran's sword length clear to enemies and allies will be crucial to having him be fun to play against. This could be done with color, or some other visual indicator overhead (maybe a stack count that shows the length), but it is pertinent that the enemies are not always caught off guard when he hits them with a long stab, or quickly slices them with a short-range spin. This should also be easy for Jirran players to understand as well, so they can properly tell how long their attacks are going to be.</p>
                    <p>The idea that Jirran uses a backpack to hold his hextech doesn't really fit with his gymnast persona. I thought about trying to make a gymnast suit that holds the hextech instead, but it didn't fit well enough for my liking. I think that finding some other way for him to lore-wise hold/build the hextech charges might help flesh out the non-gameplay aspects of his character.</p>
                    <p>It is somewhat unclear which playstyle would fit him better. Jirran could potentially be scaled in a way such that he is a bruiser/tank, or in a way that he is an assassin. I can see pros/cons of each side of this, but I think that champions that can build both ways easily are unhealthy for the game. Perhaps he could be large (which would explain his early troubles with gymnastics), and this would lead towards a more tanky build. If this was the case, I would want to add some sort of CC to some of his abilities, so he can more easily stick onto his enemies for longer fights. I think that building him as an assassin also has its perks, I think that using his pole vault to get in close while timing his hextech reset so that his sword is perfect for close range would be a cool encounter - and this would add a lot of depth to the timing/order of his ability usage with the number of hextech reserves he has left. I think the downside to this would be that he might be too strong at several ranges at once. He would likely need to have a damage nerf as his sword was longer (longer sword = thinner blade = less damage per hit), but I am not sure how good this would feel from the player's perspective.</p>
