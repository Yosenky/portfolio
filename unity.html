                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This project was made with a couple of my friends while I was at Sewanee. My main focus was on
                    designing and implementing the final boss. He's a cactus that shoots out his spines in a radial
                    pattern, and the fight increases in difficulty as you tear down his health bar! This was a blast to
                    work on, and I'll forever remember the memories I made while working on this with my friends. </p>
                <p>Use WASD to move the character, SPACE to jump, and LEFT CLICK to shoot. Enjoy! </p>

                    sizing of things so it would display properly, so it would look all wacky if I displayed it here.

                    <h3 class="overview">Overview</h3>
                    <p>This was the first game that I ever fully finished in Unity, I did all of the art and programming
                        myself. It was my first time working with the Unity Engine, and a lot of the time spent on the
                        project revolved around understanding the editor and the basics of C# coding for Unity. I played
                        flappy bird a lot on my family iPad when the game was popular, and I thought that it was a good
                        starting point for me to learn the fundamentals of Unity game development. If you want to try the
                        game out yourself, I have provided a link to the itch.io hosting for it. I hope you enjoy!</p>
