                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This project was made with a couple of my friends while I was at Sewanee. My main focus was on designing and implementing the final boss. He's a cactus that shoots out his spines in a radial pattern, and the fight increases in difficulty as you tear down his health bar! This was a blast to work on, and I'll forever remember the memories I made while working on this with my friends. </p>
                <p>Use WASD to move the character, SPACE to jump, and LEFT CLICK to shoot. Enjoy! </p>
